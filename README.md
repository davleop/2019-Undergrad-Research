# 2019 Undergrad Research

This a repository is research done under WTAMU at the Killgore Research Center.

## Installation

You have to have ```Python 3.4.*``` installed along with Java version 8 or newer.
It may work for older versions but we will not be providing support for older versions or Python ~or~ Java.

Use:
```git clone https://github.com/davleop/2019-Undergrad-Research.git```

Then you can just take the  ___StressTester___ directory and move that anywhere and you can just run the ___StressTester.jar___ file from there.
