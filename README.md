# 2019 Undergrad Research

This a repository is research done under WTAMU at the Killgore Research Center.

Our front-end is running ```Java 11``` and then we used our backend code with ```Python 3.4.5```.

## Installation

You have to have ```Python 3.4.*``` installed along with Java version 8 or newer.
It may work for older versions but we will not be providing support for older versions or Python __or__ Java.

```git clone https://github.com/davleop/2019-Undergrad-Research.git```

## Usage

Now you can just take the  ___StressTester___ directory and move that anywhere and you can just run the ___StressTester.jar___ file from there. You have to make sure the ___Python___ directory is current with the JAR file.

## Contributing

You can make a pull request but it is preferred by us to have an issue opened up first.
